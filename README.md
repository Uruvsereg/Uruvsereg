A little history about me...

I have worked as an independent since I was 14 years old in cook as chocolate maker.
when i was a child my dream was to cook like my grand mother, and that was my first study.
later, something like I was 8, i wanted to know how my toys work,that's why I study mechatronics,
    in the process I was elected as EMB president (branch of investigation in the IEEE),
    our investigations were based on development bionic prothesis that suply the function of arms,
    eyes, legs, etc., with AI incorporated to make them work easily, that makes me interested in programming,
    while leading the investigation group I started to make my final project, an pure holographic system,
    unfortunately I had to stop my mechatronic studies.
later, around 9-10 years old I was impressed by the movie's vfx, and decided to make my own movies,
    that's why I started to study vfx, editing and post production.
At 14's I play a lot videogames and I wanted to know how to do them, fortunately, my studies in mechatronics
    helps me get into that world, starting with Java, C++ and C#
